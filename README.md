# Aeroponic Bucket for Horticulture

---

### Design inspired by:

- [5 Gallon Bucket Aeroponic Seminar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eMt3kCUYnw&t=0s)

- My Personal Bill of Materials for constructing the bucket can be found [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GCScPDAFYFOd33M45uPV3TRQZUdUhXBXUN6jzlepzYU/edit?usp=sharing)

- With the above tutorial and bill of materials you can get started with an aeroponic bucket system that will require manual measurements of water and nutrient concentrations.

This GitHub repository contains the code modified to automatically monitor nutrients and water levels in the 5 gallon aeroponic bucket system.

The calibration code is based off of Atlas Scientific's [examples.](https://www.hackster.io/atlasscientific/projects)
